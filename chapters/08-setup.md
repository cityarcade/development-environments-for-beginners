# Get started

To get ready for working through the upcoming examples, we'll set up a few things.

## Make sure all the software we installed is running

### vagrant

Running `vagrant --help` should return the help text of vagrant.

### git

Running the command `git --help` should return the help text of git.

### sublime

Open up the Sublime text editor to ensure that it is installed properly.

## Create a folder for working through examples

Let's make a folder named dev-envs in your home directory.

### On Macs the home directory is:

~~~~~~~~
/Users/YOUR-USERNAME
~~~~~~~~

### On Windows:

~~~~~~~~
%userprofile%
~~~~~~~~

### On Linux:

~~~~~~~~
/home/YOUR-USERNAME
~~~~~~~~

### Shortcut

On Mac, Linux, and recent versions of Windows (in the Powershell terminal / in Windows 7+), there's a useful alias for a user's home directory, the tilde:

~~~~~~~~
~
~~~~~~~~

So, you can run a command like `cd ~`, and that'll take you to your home directory.

Once you've navigated to your home folder, create the dev-envs folder:

~~~~~~~~
mkdir dev-envs
~~~~~~~~

Change directory into dev-envs, then create directories for javascript, ruby, and python:

~~~~~~~~
cd dev-envs
mkdir javascript ruby python
~~~~~~~~

We'll use these directories to store the examples we work through later in the book.
