# What is a development environment?

### Wait, what is this development environment thing?

A development environment is like a workshop. A space and set of tools for building projects before they are released into the world wide web. Everything you need to build your project should exist in your development environment, and ideally your development environment will be similar or identical to the production environment on which your project will be released.

A development environment is a stage in the workflow, or release cycle, of a project.

### Other stages can include:
- testing
- staging
- production

There can be other stages, too, depending on the complexity of the project and the requirements you must meet for quality assurance and user testing.

In this book we take a look at setting up development environments for Ruby, JavaScript, and Python, and introduce the basics of each of those three languages.
